## What are practices that we should continue during next sprint

- Continue to provide support to group members in person and online
- Continue to meet twice a week (online or in person)

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Being proactive with what needs to be done (e.g. starting stories early, initiating conversations)
- Working on user stories consistently
- Using meeting times more productively
- Discuss design choices early

## What harmful practices should we stop using during next sprint

- Using technology before thoroughly researching Pros, Cons, and restrictions
- Starting the user stories last minute
- Not working on the user stories consistently 
- Pushing code last minute, resulting in technical issues

## What were the worst experiences during sprint 3

- Using Eclipse, since it resulted in Eclipse specific issues (error detector providing confusing or inaccurate feedback, resolving merge conflicts using Eclipse, etc)
- Undiscussed data structures, tools, etc. to be used during the project. This significantly slowed down progress as there would be a waiting period before a decision could be made. 
- Translating code written in java to an interactable website with the help of HTML
- Storing information onto the correct database
