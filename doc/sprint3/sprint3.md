Note: All of the stories were started and attempted, however not all were fully completed. This was due to Eclipse, and assignment/midterm conflicts. 
    The Eclipse Java project had issues that took a considerable amount of time to solve even after asking a TA (different from the one asked in Sprint 2) for help in person, as well as piazza. There is new issues that need to be discussed involving converting the applets to servlets.
    Allocation of priorities based on grade weight affected how much time was reasonably available to work on user stories. Many of the members had CSC309 A2 (worth 20%) due on Monday, and which is a very large assignment involving technologies such as JS, Jquery, Ajax, SQLite3, and RESTful API creation. The CSC301 midterm is on the day Sprint 3 is due, worth 25%. There is also a lengthy CSC384 assignment due Friday.
