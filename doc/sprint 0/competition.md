Since the focus of our product is a note taking and timetable/calendar platform, we have two sections of competitors that solve similar problems.

## Timetable

**Griddy** (http://griddy.org) and **Semesterly** (https://uoft.semester.ly/) are our main timetable competitors that are not associated to UofT. Both allow users to input courses from all of the UofT campuses, enable timetable sharing, and save added courses using cookies. Griddy provides a readable description of programs in a program search bar. Semesterly has an attractive user interface, and allows users to rate courses and find friends. However, they both rely on developers who are not associated with UofT to update their data, which results with out of date or inaccurate data (e.g. sections that are closed are not shown as closed/cancelled, Semesterly's most recent table is Winter 2018 which is also missing UTM courses).

**U of T Course Planner** (http://www.uoftcourseplanner.com) is smaller competitor since it does not have a name that uniquely brands itself like Griddy and Semesterly. It seems to be developed by a single student instead of a group. It has an attractive user interface, can search for courses from all of the campuses, auto generates timetable suggestions, and allows an option for a max conflict hour time frame. However, there is no share or save feature for the timetable.

**University of Toronto Timetable Builder** (https://ttb.utoronto.ca/ttb/#!/) is a timetable planner with only UTSC courses. 
**UofT Faculty of Arts and Science Timetable** (https://timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca/) is a timetable planner only for UTSG courses.
**UTM Timetable Planner** (https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/) is a timetable planner only for UTM courses.
These are official timetables developed and maintained by UofT, and so are usually up to date. The planner for UTSC also generates timetables randomly based on three time criterias (early, balanced, late), and a link to share the timetable. The UTM planner usually has an option to see the course's room location on a floor plan map. The UTSC and UTM planners have the option to print the timetables or save them as a PDF. However, all do not have a save feature where a user can come back to in order to edit.

**UofT's official Degree Explorer** (https://degreeexplorer.utoronto.ca) has features that are not available to the other timetables due to the user having to login with their student account, which contains all their ACORN data. It can show what courses are needed to complete the user's program, and whether or not the user has the prerequisites to take a course. However it does not provide information on the time or semester that the course is available for, (e.g. a course may only be available in the Fall, but the planner will allow the user to add it to the Winter).


## Note Taking

**Notes.io** (http://notes.io) and **Shrib** (https://shrib.com) are smaller competitors that offers a simple, quick, and easy platform for taking notes. However, they have ads on their webpages and are meant for one page notes instead of a collection of notes.
 
**OneNote** (https://www.onenote.com), **Google Docs** (https://www.google.com/docs), and **Microsoft Word** (https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx) are our main competitors for note taking. Notes are automatically saved on a cloud using the user's account, can be organized into groups, offer live collaboration and sharing, offer robust note taking abilities, and many export options.

## Analysis

### How is your product different?
The competition for scheduling only takes into consideration the specific courses which are being searched, and not helping the student find which courses they can/cannot take. Our product is different because it will allow for timetable planning with program and completed courses in mind, allow for clear note collaboration and tracking of lectures, and be targeted to a niche group of students. Our product will also enable clearer note taking with integration into the rest of the product (such as integration with your timetable). We will also integrate a course/prof rating scheme scrapped from RateMyProf, which is not something that most of the competitors have done. 

### Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
Users are specifically students at the UTM campus. They may want a timetable generator, be looking for a specific type of course, or just want to be more organized.

*Timetable 1*: Tom, Melinda, and Brandon have already chosen their courses and want to be able to organise times when they can hang out. They currently do so by asking in their group chat when the others are available e.g. "who else is free at 1 on Mondays".

*Timetable 2*: Brandon wants to create a new timetable, but he finds that adding courses manually is tiresome. He would like to see multiple potential versions of schedules based on his course selection.

*Note taking*: Melinda wants to take notes while in class. Her binder and laptop are both too big to fit on the table, so she needs to be able to take notes on her tablet. She wants to be able to share these notes with her friend and also view what notes she took last week.

*Map*: Brandon is new to the university and has problems finding which building to go to and where to find certain rooms. He needs a tool that will help him navigate from one class to another within the ten-minute time-frame he gets at the start of every lecture.


### Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, and what would it take for them to do so?
The note taking competitors did not focus on UTM students since they wanted to appeal to a broad target audience. By appealing to a broad audience, there is a larger opportunity for them to gain many users and also create revenue from account packages and ads. In order for them to appeal to UTM students, they would have to incorporate UTM details such as a UTM specific calendar. However, that would take too much effort for the money that can be generated from that. 

The timetable planner competitors generally did not focus on UTM due to wanting to appeal to a general UofT student audience for an all in one website. It would take more time to incorporate campus specific details such as program requirements. The timetable planners that are campus specific may have focused on one campus only due to the potential of a crash or lag due to too many users.
