## Project objectives 
Provide UTM students with an application that improves their academic life by offering features such as university maps, note-taking tools, and robust schedule planning. The app will allow users to connect or share with friends in order to compare their schedules, and collaborate in note taking.

## Key users

1. The confused first year UTM student, represented by Brandon. This user has friends that they want to make time for, and are likely to explore or change their potential program of study.

2. The UTM student trying to choose a course, represented by Melinda. This user wants to choose a course based on their own set of criteria, but has to do so through manual trial and error through adding courses on a timetable, or through recommendations from friends and Facebook groups.

3. The disorganized UTM student, represented by Tom. This user has poor organization skills, often forgetting important deadlines and losing notes. However they want to improve themselves by using tools to stay organized.

## Scenarios
*Timetable 1*: Tom, Melinda, and Brandon have already chosen their courses and want to be able to organise times when they can hang out. They currently do so by asking in their group chat when the others are available e.g. "who else is free at 1 on Mondays".

*Timetable 2*: Brandon wants to create a new timetable, but he finds that adding courses manually is tiresome. He would like to see multiple potential versions of schedules based on his course selection.

*Note taking*: Melinda wants to take notes while in class. Her binder and laptop are both too big to fit on the table, so she needs to be able to take notes on her tablet. She wants to be able to share these notes with her friend and also view what notes she took last week.

*Map*: Brandon is new to the university and has problems finding which building to go to and where to find certain rooms. He needs a tool that will help him navigate from one class to another within the ten-minute time-frame he gets at the start of every lecture.

## Principles
1. Satisfy user base over broad user base
  
    - Cater to UTM students and ignore other students in order to provide maximum satisfaction
    
2. Consistency over customizability
  
    - Make the website logically consistent in design between mobile and pc at the cost of customizability
    
3. Minimalism over functionality 
  
    - Create a sparse workspace with focus on few key features
