## Decision making 
Our team has worked collaboratively in person using Google Docs and whiteboard drawings. We have also used Facebook Messengerâ€™s group call feature for off campus meetings and decision making. We make decisions as a team. Suggestions were taken, all perspectives are discussed, and then votes are cast. For role-specific decisions, the respective roles will discuss with each other and present their perspectives to the rest of the group members.

## Prioritizing user stories 
We decided that the priority was defined as how important a story was for the project, such as how notes integrated into a calendar is a top priority because it is a large aspect of our project. User story priorities came around an average of 2 rounds of Scrum Poker voting. For most stories, we had to come to consensus by having everyone explain what their reasoning was for choosing their Scrum Poker number, and seeing who was convinced after everyone has brought up their perspective.

## Meetings 
During the time spent for sprint 0, our team has utilized multiple techniques to share our thoughts towards the project. Every main idea within our project, user stories, project idea, etc, have been decided in person or through group call. We have made a schedule for our team to meet in a study room to run our meetings, which is generally one to three hours a week, once or twice a week as needed. Many of the smaller detailed pieces of the agenda were done through Facebook Messenger. Messenger also helped to clarify any unfamiliarities our team had towards the project, allowing us all to have input to the discussion.

## Next phase
Assign priority user stories to roles that need to implement it. Set goals for pacing user story completion, to ensure completion. Fill out the documents needed for sprint 1.
