#### The tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for our team: ####
* Messenger
  * Everyone already had a Facebook account
  * It indicates if someone has read your message
  * Allows group calls for online meetings
* Google Drive
  * Easy to share all documents to the team
  * Live document updates, perfect for live collaboration
  * Reliable storage, (never a server outage)
* Regular Meetings
  * Allowed us to collaboratively solve problems as a team
  * Allowed us to make sure nobody is slacking on their work
* Git Flow
  * Members only needed to worry about their own user stories since they had their own branches
  * Allowed easy roll backs to previous commits to undo major changes that broke code, while being able to maintain a stable working version on Master
  * Everything worked before merging/submitting to Master
* Pivotal Tracker
  * Allowed us to keep track of the work we were doing each sprint, along with an icebox full of stories we could choose to do
* MongoDB and Spring Boot
  * Allowed for easy storage of different aspects of the app, such as the scraped courses, timetables, etc
  * Allowed for easy queries to the database through automatically building functions
  * Allowed for easy java function integration into endpoints 
* RESTful API
  * Allowed for easy communication with server and client

#### Tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for our team: ####
* Regular Meetings
  * Technical difficulties, booking study rooms, finding a good time-slot for us to meet, sometimes lack of updates or ideas to discuss.
* Eclipse
  * Running old code instead of updated code. The problem was fixed by moving the .java file to a different folder.
  * Library mismatches: code would compile for one member but not for another
  * Encountering new problems and glitches with eclipse that no one could solve
  * Eclipse would show errors and not run code even if there were no errors. Had to copy and paste lines/code in place (no actual changes) so that eclipse could recheck errors.
* Java Applet/servlet
  * Legacy code that isn’t supported anymore, would require users to run internet explorer to launch our website
  * Code that would work on a JFrame (A File that existed and could be found) wouldn’t find the file when converted to a JApplet

#### If we had to continue working as a team, our ideal process based on our experience working together would be: ####
* Using technologies that are still supported (e.g. not Java Applet)
* Planning out technologies prior to constructing with them. Includes researching each potential tool’s abilities and limitations.
* Holding meetings once a week instead of twice a week
* Having better estimates for user stories
