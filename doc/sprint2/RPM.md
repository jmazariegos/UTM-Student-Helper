Note: All of the stories were started and attempted, however not all were fully completed. This was due to Eclipse, and assignment/midterm conflicts. The Eclipse Java project had issues involving aspects such as the build path, and took a considerable amount of time to solve even after asking a TA for help in person. Majority of members had other assessments for other courses, specifically at least 1-2 term test on the day after Sprint 2 is due, which affected how much time was available to work on user stories.
