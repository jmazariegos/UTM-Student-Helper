## What are practices that we should continue during next sprint

- Continue to meet ~twice a week

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Members should start early (at the end of the previous sprint)
- Working on user stories consistently
- Raising technical issues early 
- Using meeting times more productively
- Using Pivotal Tracker user story IDs in git commits

## What harmful practices should we stop using during next sprint

- Starting the user stories last minute
- Not working on the user stories consistently 
- Only raising technical issues late into the sprint 

## What were the worst experiences during sprint 1

- Figuring out technical issues through group voice call
- Starting user stories last minute due to other commitments
- Having to catch everyone up on what is expected via the marking scheme / handout
- Undiscussed data structures, tools, etc. to be used during the project. This significantly slowed down progress as there would be a waiting period before a decision could be made.
