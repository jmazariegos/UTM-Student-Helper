        "description": "The question of what it means to be human has been at the core of anthropology for over two centuries, and it remains as pressing now as it ever was. This course introduces students to some classic attempts at addressing this question with specific reference to the nature of personhood and social life. By engaging with the writings of Marx, Weber, Freud, and DeBeauvoir among other great thinkers of the modern age, students will develop deeper knowledge of the major theories guiding anthropological research. We will pay close attention to how arguments are constructed in these texts and focus on the methodologies that these pioneers of social thought developed in their inquiries. The course covers enduring topics ranging from the production of social inequality, what it means to be an individual, how collective life is shaped by economic markets, and the role of religion in shaping human experience, to develop an understanding of central issues facing the world today.

It begins with an examination of the fundamental biological principles of growth and how these are expressed throughout evolution. It explores the evolution of growth patterns among primates and hominins and compares patterns of growth among the living primates. The course examines human growth and development throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence and explores the influence of genetic, epigenetic and endocrine processes on the plasticity of human growth that ultimately produces the variability observed in our species. The goal of the course is to provide students with a complex understanding of how evolutionary and environmental processes interact in the production of growth and health in human populations.

Among questions asked will be: Why do animals use or not use tools? Why are animals aggressive? How does physiology influence what chimpanzees can eat and what's healthy to eat? Can chimpanzees use language? Do chimpanzees use medicine? Just how different are chimpanzee bones, muscles, and brains from our own? Throughout the class we will turn to use chimpanzees as a model to better understand ourselves and our place in nature. [24L]",

This course attempts to introduce students to both the scope and seriousness of present ecological concerns, as well as some core principles and concepts in the field of the intersection of environment and culture, through the lens of feature films. Themes such as the precautionary principle, urban/rural dualisms, ecofeminism, deep ecology, and the overwhelming burden placed on poor populations by environmental destruction are but a few of the areas which will be examined through the use of feature films, both classic and contemporary. We will do this in part by touching on some of the major writers and classic essays in the field, Class lectures will be supplemented by audiovisuals, guest lectures and class discussions. [36L]",

        "description": "Fresh water has become one of the world's most sought-after commodities and is said to soon replace oil in terms of its projected value. Scarce, increasingly polluted, and overused, water and the question of how we are to manage this precious resource has moved to center stage for politicians, financiers, bankers, development specialists, and activists all over the world. This class delves into the politics of water from an anthropological perspective through a set of readings that conceptualize water not only as resource but also as meaningful substance, symbol, and mediator of human and non-human relations. We ask how water is understood and managed - privately, as public good, as commons - and how these diverse ways of understanding and managing water have become intensely politicized. Class will consist mainly of discussions of ethnographic readings but also of hands-on class exercises and field trips. There will be at least one required field trip outside of class time (weekends and/or Reading Week) with additional travel costs that students will be required to pay through ancillary fees. See Anthropology department website for more details. In some years, students may additionally have the option of participating in an international learning experience during Reading Week that will have an additional cost and application process.

We will pay close attention to how arguments are constructed in these texts and focus on the methodologies that these pioneers of social thought developed in their inquiries. The course covers enduring topics ranging from the production of social inequality, what it means to be an individual, how collective life is shaped by economic markets, and the role of religion in shaping human experience, to develop an understanding of central issues facing the world today.

On our way we will survey chimpanzee warfare, tool using octopuses, eusocial ants, and night-time hunter-gatherer sentinels - all of which will allow us to better understand the forces that shaped unparalleled cooperative networks in humans. Finally, we will investigate the cognitive and behavioural blessings and curses associated with the drive to belong to a group.

Through lectures, labs, films and writing assignments we will get an intimate look at every aspect of chimpanzee biology and behavior. Among questions asked will be: Why do animals use or not use tools? Why are animals aggressive? How does physiology influence what chimpanzees can eat and what's healthy to eat? Can chimpanzees use language? Do chimpanzees use medicine? Just how different are chimpanzee bones, muscles, and brains from our own? Throughout the class we will turn to use chimpanzees as a model to better understand ourselves and our place in nature. [24L]",

        "description": "News stories are used to explore areas of biology, to learn about the process of science, and to find and assess the validity of information. The topics for the course modules will change yearly because the course is designed to give students the tools to explore the biology behind the news, not to teach a comprehensive survey of biological facts. Reading, writing, and research skills are emphasized. This is a biology course for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as other non-Biology Sciences. [36L]",

Students will learn that plants require energy to support metabolism and growth, and that these processes are highly regulated in order to achieve homeostasis. Topics covered include: biology of the plant cell, plant morphology, plant respiration and photosynthesis, transport processes, regulation of growth and development, and plant ecophysiology. Principles and mechanisms of plant form and function are developed in lectures and laboratories. [24L, 10T, 15P]",

Examples involve adaptive strategies in competing with rivals, choosing mates, and avoiding parasites. We also ask how adaptive behaviour is controlled; what are the genetic, developmental, and physiological mechanisms underlying behaviour? Assignments involve observing and analyzing (suggesting alternative explanations/ hypotheses) for behaviour, followed by a use of these skills to critique a published scientific paper. [48L, 72P]",

This course addresses the use of organ systems to find and process food, escape enemies by locomotion, reproduce by pollination vectors, filter nutrients, exchange gases, coordinate and make decisions. Content includes the mechanics of moving in fluids by swimming and flying, sending and receiving of signals at body surfaces, the microstructure of materials. Forces are seen to have adaptively affected the shape and leverage of skeletons. [24L, 36P]",

We ask why animals behave in a particular way, i.e. how does their behaviour enhance success in survival or reproduction? Examples involve adaptive strategies in competing with rivals, choosing mates, and avoiding parasites. We also ask how adaptive behaviour is controlled; what are the genetic, developmental, and physiological mechanisms underlying behaviour? Assignments involve observing and analyzing (suggesting alternative explanations/ hypotheses) for behaviour, followed by a use of these skills to critique a published scientific paper. No laboratory or field work is included. [48L]",

Underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure and gene expression are explored, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, or non-coding RNAs. Examples focus predominantly on eukaryotes (e.g. plants, insects, humans) and highlight how epigenetic marks are set, maintained, and involved in shaping phenotypic outcomes. The course will also enable students to apply knowledge and basic principles to recent scientific literature in this dynamic field. [24L, 12T]",

Reading, writing, and research skills are emphasized. This is a biology course for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as other non-Biology Sciences. [36L]",

Chemistry will be taught on a need-to-know basis in order to consider some contemporary applications. The course will focus on three themes in the realm of human health: nutrition for the prevention of disease, diagnostic tests for the detection of disease and drug discovery for the treatment of disease. Among the questions that may be addressed are \"What is the nutritional difference between vitamins from foods and those from supplements?\", \"Should ketchup be considered a vegetable?\", \"How do diagnostic strips work?\", \"What advances in microfluidics have provided inexpensive diagnostics for use in remote areas?\", \"How are drug targets identified?\", and \"What is the path from drug discovery to bringing a drug to market?\". The roles of nutritional, analytical and medicinal chemistry in these processes will be studied. [24L, 12T]",

The research will be conducted under the supervision of a chemistry faculty member other than the student's CHM489Y5 supervisor. The research topic must not overlap that of the student's CHM489Y5 project. The goals of this course are to achieve literature research expertise as well as in-depth knowledge of a particular chemistry topic, while perfecting scientific writing and oral presentation skills. Evaluation is based on a final written report describing the aims and results of the research, as well as an oral presentation of the work. The course is normally taken in the student's fourth year, in either the Fall or Winter terms, but may be taken in the Summer term. Enrolment in CHM485H5 requires submitting an application to the department before the end of the term prior to that in which it is intended to undertake the research. Independent Studies Application Forms may be found at http://uoft.me/cpsforms Applications should be submitted to the CPS Undergraduate Assistant. Registration on ROSI/ACORN is also required. Students are encouraged to consult with, and obtain the consent of, prospective supervisors before applying for enrolment. [24L]",

Students will critically assess how a wide variety of technological-mediated practices have brought about significant social changes by affecting community structures and notions of individual identity, facilitating cultural exchanges and misunderstandings, impacting public opinion, and enabling new modes of political organization and unrest. As part of that endeavour we will examine various theories of collective action, including collective behaviour theory, resource mobilization, new social movements, gift economies, and class struggle. These theoretical perspectives will be evaluated based on their potential to inform our understandings of historical and contemporary examples of communities of practice. [24L]",

This course will introduce students to viewpoints, vision and visibility in surveillance studies. The class will look at a range of topics from information politics, identification, privacy, security, suspicion, social sorting, bodies, borders and biometrics to explore a range of perspectives under the surveillance studies umbrella.

Addressing issues of Digital Media design, students in collaborative groups will develop and/or employ appropriate research methodologies, read relevant material to design the game flow, create characters, and design storyboards / wireframes. Students will identify an educational need, define requirements, and develop a web-based interactive game to meet them. They will conduct iterative usability testing and finally build a website featuring their semi-functional prototype. The course does not require programming experience, but a familiarity with web design, image rendering, and animation software could be an asset. [24L]",

        "description": "Marshall McLuhan was one of the first theorists to conceptualize media as an environment. Media were no longer an instrument or a tool but a system that would capture its audience within. Our contemporary media environments are multifarious; they are networked, immersive, and sometimes ubiguitous. We interface with these networks with different means: screens, goggles, watches, and devices that tap right into our brain. This course investigates different types of media environments from social media platforms; video game consoles; infrastructures and smart cities, to virtual and augmented realities and beyond. The course investigates how we interface with our environments, and how these environments structure and condition our possibilities. The question of media environments is thus also a question of culture and politics. Media environments are domains of artistic, scientific, and commercial experimentation and exploration. Students will be exposed to a variety of these technologies both from a conceptual and a practical perspective. [24L]",

In turn, how organisms feed, breath, grow, and reproduce are integral to mitigating large-scale climate changes and organic cycles. Climate also works in tandem with large-scale geological processes to reshape the surface of our home. As such, these processes are intimately linked and ensures our planet remains habitable. After introducing how the Earth works, topics discussed will include how life on Earth has evolved, how ecosystems have changed in response to weather and climate change, and how large-scale geological processes affect climate and life [24L]",

Weathering, erosion, and transport destroy mountains, carve the landscape we live in, and accumulate sedimentary rocks. Heat and pressure within the Earth metamorphose rocks as they are buried.

This course will focus on the reconstruction and interpretation of ancient carbonate and siliciclastic paleoenvironments based on the analysis of sedimentary structures, depositional environments, stratigraphic successions, and fossils. The interplay between biological and geological factors responsible for sedimentary deposits will form the core of the course, including the physical transport and biological accumulation of sediments, the effects of climate-driven sea-level change on sediment deposition, and how the evolution of, and innovations within, biological systems have profoundly affected sedimentary processes over the past 3.5 billion years. This course will include a laboratory component in addition to a field trip allowing for first-hand experience with describing and interpreting sedimentological units. [36L, 24P]",

Why are some firms profitable while others are not? How can firms create, capture and maintain their profits in the face of competition? The first part of the course will be devoted to the building blocks of strategy, including industry analysis, positioning, and sustainability of competitive advantage. Next we will use game theoretical tools to analyze strategic interaction among firms, such as strategic pricing, entry and competitive bidding. Lastly, the course will cover the scope of the firm and technologic competition. Students shall learn from the course, the ability to identify and categorize major strategic problems, and suggest and evaluate candidate strategies. [24L]",

Understanding the nature and the sources of this great transformation is important for at least two reasons. First, it may provide valuable lessons of economic development for other developing countries. Second, the Chinese economy has become increasingly integrated with the world economy. The growth prospect of China is important for both China and the rest of the world. This course will examine China's growth and development through the lens of the modern macroeconomic theory.

It will explore how tourism relates to mobility, globalization, recreation and outdoor activity, planning, the environment, cultural identities, protected areas, and wildlife conservation. This course begins with an introduction to tourism more generally and then focuses in on critical perspectives and the development of eco-tourism, cultural tourism, and volunteer tourism. As part of this course, students may have the option of participating in an international learning experience that will have an additional cost and application process. [24L]",

Yet each community, each country, strives for survival and prosperity with little regard for its impact on others. These are the opening words from the report of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, which first popularized the concept of sustainable development. In this course we examine 'environment' and 'development' and 'human well-being' as inseparable challenges. We consider global, regional, and local environmental problems from the perspectives of developing nations, and investigate the economic, social, and political roots of these problems. [24L, 12T]",

It investigates the theoretical and political concerns animating South Asian cultural practices and their criticism (nationalism, Marxism, secularism, anti-fundamentalism, Islam, feminism, postcolonialism, issues of diaspora and globalization), and addresses the key question of how to approach practices of modernism and postmodernism in the postcolony.

Objects of study will range broadly: porcelain, tableware and foodstuffs, screens and silver, naturalia and their elaborate mounts, miniatures, prints and books, paintings (Dutch Still Life, Las Meninas) which put the world of things on display.",

We will survey prevailing theories on mental health, illness, and treatment. Investigate psychiatric diagnoses such as (juvenile) Conduct Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Psychopathy, hereunder their application and relevance in risk assessment, behavior prediction, and offender rehabilitation. We will also discuss methodological, ethical, and legal issues in the field, for example, the scientific validity of psychiatric diagnostics, the ethical implications of using psychiatric assessments in forensic institutions, and the legal responsibility of mentally ill offenders.

Tree-rings reflect changes in their local environment, and they are sensitive to factors that limit biological processes such as light, soil moisture, temperature and disturbance. Environment changes are 'encoded' in the physical properties of tree-rings (e.g., ring-width, wood density or isotopes). This course will provide students with the theoretical background and technical skills needed to cross-date, measure, analyse and interpret tree-ring data, and use this information to address practical research questions.

We skate on frozen ponds, ski down snow covered mountains, drive through snow blizzards and watch how ice jams in rivers cause rivers to swell and floods to occur. The duration and the thickness of snow and ice increase rapidly northwards, and glaciers are found in mountainous areas and in large parts of the Arctic region. Given that snow and ice impact heavily on the Canadian way of life, this course seeks to understand the dynamics of snow and ice in a hydrological context. This course will examine snow properties, snow cover distribution, glacier hydrology, melt runoff, and ice in its many forms (lake ice, river ice, sea ice, and ground ice). This course will also examine some of the recent observed changes occurring in the cryosphere regions of Canada. This course includes an off campus field trip. This course fulfills 2 field days.

        "description": "This course is structured around one major field trip that will occur before fall-term courses begin, preparatory work, and approximately bi-weekly course meetings during the regular academic term to complete complementary work in computer and/or wet laboratories. Field projects will involve analyses and mapping of vegetation, soils, aquatic systems, hydrology, and/or geomorphology, and subsequent data analysis. Students will be required to write one major research paper and present projects to the class. Each student is required to pay the costs of his/her transportation and accommodation. Students must register on ACORN, on a first-come first-serve and non-refundable deposit basis. The deposit must be received by the Department within one week from the first day of enrollment or the student will be dropped automatically from the course. Students should contact the Department to find out more details about the specific fieldtrip plans. This course fulfills 7 field days.",

        "description": "This course looks critically at how places and people are come to be labelled as indigenous and how this labelling is tied to political, social, economic, and environmental systems that shape the spaces in which we all live. Furthermore, this course asks how spaces and places can be indigenized and what this means for social relations. We will study these processes at multiple scales - from international solidarity networks to nationalist claims on territory to an individual's sense of belonging. We will examine a wide range of topics related to these processes such as the geographies of education, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, resource conflicts, media representations, identity formation and well-being. While we will be focusing on indigenizing geographies within the context of Canada as a settler nation, we will also engage with how indigenous geographies shape and are shaped by nationalisms in other parts of the world. As part of this course, students may have the option of participating in an international learning experience that will have an additional cost and application process. This course fulfills 1-5 field day (to be adjusted according to student activity) . [24L, 12T]",

The first half of the course examines the French colony along the St. Lawrence River and its conquest by Great Britain. How did French culture survive? Political topics include Rebellions and Confederation. The course also explores the many peoples who arrived on our shores: stone-age hunters, French soldiers and brides, white and black Loyalists, and famine Irish; as well as later waves heading to eastern cities and western prairies. Twentieth century topics include modern social movements; the nation at war; popular culture; consumer society; and issues of Canadian identity. Lectures, debates and weekly tutorials help students master historical methods. [48L, 24T]",

        "description": "Students will learn about fundamental grammatical concepts, focusing on the major grammatical categories in English and how they interact at the phrase level. They will be introduced to the main constituents of English sentences and learn about the basic relationship between tense, aspect, and modality. Students will learn to apply this knowledge as a tool to think analytically about English, evaluating various registers and styles, and gaining an awareness of their own style of speaking and writing. Depending on the instructor, this course may be delivered fully or partially online. Students are required to take the final exam at the UTM campus. Arrangements will be made for proctored exam writing for students who are registered at Ontario university locations outside of the GTA. This course does not count towards the Linguistic Studies minor or major program. [24L, 12T]",

The course examines possible ways of describing and formalizing meaning at the level of the word, phrase, and sentence. The course naturally incorporates students\u2019 understanding of syntax and morphology thereby fostering a more holistic understanding of linguistic analysis. It also provides the foundation for more specialised studies in Semantics and Pragmatics. Topics include: sense and reference, compositionality, lexical relations, entailment, presupposition, event types, thematic roles, deixis, implicature, predicate logic, and quantification.

They will be introduced to the main constituents of English sentences and learn about the basic relationship between tense, aspect, and modality. Students will learn to apply this knowledge as a tool to think analytically about English, evaluating various registers and styles, and gaining an awareness of their own style of speaking and writing. Depending on the instructor, this course may be delivered fully or partially online. Students are required to take the final exam at the UTM campus. Arrangements will be made for proctored exam writing for students who are registered at Ontario university locations outside of the GTA.

Such topics include, for example, the difference between art and pornography, the possibility of life after death, the evolution vs. creationism debate, the ethics of abortion and doctor-assisted suicide, and the possibility of intelligent robots. Each topic will be introduced via relevant public media (e.g., articles from the New York Times series \u201cThe Stone\u201d and similar pieces from The Guardian, CBC news, NPR) and other popular sources (e.g., Ted Talks, youtube videos)) and then pursued in several accessible readings from the philosophical literature. A shared \u201clibrary\u201d of readings for the course will be built up (e.g., on Blackboard) by the instructors and students and updated as new issues of popular interest arise. [36L]",

During the Fall semester, you will attend two 1-hour PHL103H/PHL113H lectures each week, and teach one tutorial of 20-25 students, meeting with them for 1 hour each week. You will grade their papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed. You will be paid for approximately 100 hours of work each semester, for a total of 200 hours, at the current hourly wage for CUPE Unit 1. The second component of the course is a seminar that meets once per week for 3 hours each time, during the fall term. Most of the seminar will be devoted to more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHL103H/PHL113H; but you will also discuss the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy-grading papers, prompting and guiding discussion, and so forth. Third, during the winter term you will write a seminar paper, on a topic of your choosing, under the supervision of a UTM Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area. You will also present your work orally at an undergraduate research conference held jointly with the Socrates students from the St. George campus. Admittance to the Socrates Project is by application only. Instructions and the application form are available on the web at: http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/employment/cupe-3902-unit-",

The course also considers some questions about film as a philosophical genre: of the medium of film as an alternative medium (an alternative to language and explicit argument) of philosophical expression; of whether and how film may convey philosophical insight otherwise unavailable; and of the role of interpretation in understanding film philosophically.

The course is intended for those who are not trained in Physics and Mathematics but who nevertheless want to gain insight into this interesting and important field in a non-intimidating way. We will discover important concepts and theories through applications to everyday phenomena, including new energy sources, laser surgery, flat-screen TVs, wireless communications, GPS, etc. More advanced, but nevertheless fascinating and popular topics, will also be covered: time travel, relativity, ultracold atoms, quantum entanglement, black holes and the Higgs boson. No previous background in Physics is expected; high school algebra is recommended. [24L]",

This course provides a rigorous introduction to the concepts, approaches and tools that physicists use to describe the physical world through the study of classical and modern mechanics. Topics include mathematical physics, kinematics and dynamics as well as conservation laws for energy and momentum. Special relativity will be introduced as a topic that successfully addresses problems that arose in classical mechanics. [36L,15P,12T]",

        "description": "To understand politics in our information-abundant world, we need ways to make sense of the political information that surrounds us. In this course, we ask what makes for good evidence and what makes for convincing argument. We do so by raising a series of weekly topics on which there is a mass of available information - topics like climate change, political correctness, populism, and democracy promotion, among others - and discussing fundamentally different perspectives on each topic. In the end, students will develop a fuller sense of what constitutes a well-argued and evidence-supported analysis of the political. (24L, 12T)",

Comparative politics compares the ways people and institutions interact, in different countries and regions of the world (including both developing and developed), to produce what we call \"politics.\" The course brings to bear different interpretive frameworks (political culture, political economy, identity politics, and institutional analysis) to help us understand this interaction. Topics include: the formation, development and eventual decay of political institutions such as the nation-state, political regimes, parties, party systems and local governments; the ideas and interests shaping political behaviour; and the reasons why, and the ways in which, groups mobilize politically.

It also provides a critical framework to analyze and understand inequalities of an environmental kind. These inequalities are often based around identities of race, class and gender, such that marginalized groups are made to bear the burden of environmental externalities like pollution. Why are First Nations in Canada less likely to have access to safe drinking water? Why are industrial plants often in low-income neighborhoods? After critical examinations of the theories and foundations of environmental justice, this course uses a case study approach to understanding the concepts and the ways in which it has shaped modern society.

We will read and write about theoretical and empirical work in the sociology of migration and related fields. [24L]",

In addition to sampling error, non-sampling errors (refusals, not-at-home, lies, inaccuracies, etc.) are always present, and can produce serious biases. The course covers: design of surveys, sources of bias, randomized response surveys. Techniques of sampling; stratification, clustering, unequal probability selection. Sampling inference, estimates of population mean and variances, ratio estimation, observational data; correlation vs. causation, missing data, sources of bias. [36L, 12T]",

Students will study women's historical participation in and exclusion from policy decision-making processes, and evaluate the impact of feminism and women's activism on Canadian public policies. Using intersectional framework, the course will also examine different ways in which public policies can be made more responsive to gender and diversity concerns as well as the role public policy can play in overcoming gender inequalities. We will investigate key historical changes in public policies affecting Canadian women in such areas as family, workplace, education, poverty-welfare, sexuality and reproductive laws, immigration and refugee laws, and global issues. The course concludes with women's achievements in this area. [24L, 10T]",
